Certainly! Here's a more professional and clearer version of the README for your SSH Terminal project with M5Cardputer and ESP32:
# SSH Terminal with M5Cardputer

## Overview
This project enables you to create a user-friendly SSH terminal using an M5Cardputer coupled with an ESP32 microcontroller. It allows remote SSH server connections and interactions utilizing the M5Cardputer's integrated keyboard and display.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites before starting:

- M5Cardputer device
- ESP32 development environment
- Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Required Libraries
- M5Cardputer library
- libssh_esp32
- libssh

## Installation Guide

### Setting Up the Environment
1. **Arduino IDE Configuration**: 
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Navigate to `File > Preferences`.
    - Add the ESP32 package URL to "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
      ```
      https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
      ```

2. **ESP32 Board Manager Installation**:
    - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`.
    - Search for "esp32" and install the ESP32 board manager.

3. **Board Selection**:
    - Select your M5Cardputer device under `Tools > Board`.

### Libraries Installation
1. **M5Cardputer Library**:
    - Install via `Sketch > Include Library > M5Cardputer`.
2. **libssh_esp32 and libssh**:
    - Download the libraries from their respective repositories.
    - Install using `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library`.

### Configuration
- Configure WiFi and SSH settings in the Arduino sketch:
  - Set your WiFi SSID and password.
  - Define the SSH server address, username, and password.

### Uploading the Sketch
- Connect your M5Cardputer to your computer.
- Select the appropriate COM port.
- Upload the sketch to the M5Cardputer.

## Usage
1. **Device Initialization**:
    - Power on your M5Cardputer.
    - The screen will display a terminal-like interface.

2. **SSH Connection**:
    - Input the SSH server address, username, and password.
    - Press Enter to establish the connection.

3. **Interacting with SSH Server**:
    - Use the keyboard to type and send commands to the SSH server.

## Features
- User-friendly SSH terminal interface on the M5Cardputer.
- Keyboard support for command input.
- Configurable WiFi and SSH server settings in the Arduino sketch.
